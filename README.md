# Machine Learning Lab – FSU Jena

This repository contains my completed exercises for the Machine Learning Laboratory course at **Friedrich Schiller University Jena (FSU Jena)**. The lab focuses on implementing and understanding fundamental machine learning algorithms and techniques.

## Repository Structure

```
machine_learning_lab/
├── Bagging_Boosting/        # Ensemble methods: Bagging and Boosting
├── Decision_Trees/          # Decision Tree algorithms
├── Feature_Maps/            # Feature mapping techniques
├── Linear_Regression/       # Linear Regression implementation
├── Logistic_Regression/     # Logistic Regression implementation
├── Naive_Bayes/             # Naive Bayes classifier
├── Polynomial_Regression/   # Polynomial Regression implementation
└── README.md                # Project overview and instructions
```

Each directory contains:
- Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating the implementation and results
- Python scripts with modular code (where applicable)
- Sample datasets or links to datasets used
- Brief explanations or comments within the code for clarity

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python 3.x
- **Libraries and Tools:**
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Scikit-learn
  - Matplotlib
  - Jupyter Notebook

## Getting Started

To run the notebooks and scripts locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JKlueber/ML.git
   cd ML
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Navigate to the desired notebook and run the cells to see the results.
